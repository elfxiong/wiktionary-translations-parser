# wiktionary-translations-parser

For some editions of Wiktionary, extract translation pairs on each page.

## Input

Eventually the input would a `.zim` file that contains all pages of an edition.

- Wiktionary dumps in `.zim` format can be obtained from [kiwix](https://download.kiwix.org/zim/wiktionary/).

For now, we are dealing with individual `.html` pages from the editions we're working on. For example [g√®ne in French edition](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/g%C3%A8ne).

## Output

Each translation tuple consists of these fields:

- `edition`: the edition of Wiktionary the translation pair is from. It is a 2-3 letter code used in the Wiktionary url.
- `headword`: the word that is being translated.
- `head_lang`: the language of the `headword`. It might be different from the language of the edition.
- `translation`: the translation of the `headword`.
- `trans_lang`: the language the `headword` is translated into.
- `trans_lang_code`: the language code of `tranlation_lang`. This is the edition code used by Wiktionary, and it is [not from a single ISO standard](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Languages#Language_codes).
- `pos`: the part of speech of the `headword` in `head_lang`.

The output is a `.csv` with these seven columns.

## Dependencies

- `beautifulsoup4`: used for parsing html.
- `requests`: used to make http calls and fetch `.html` from the Intenet. Will eventually be removed as we will be dealing with locally stored files.
- `pycountry` and `iso-639`: used for conversion between language codes. Used when you do not specify an wiktionary edition code.
- `repoze.lru`: LRU cache which significantly improve performance for `.zim`. 

Install in a `virtualenv` as appropriate.
To install all dependencies (you don't have to):

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

To install one by one, use `pip install [PACKAGE NAME]`. 

## Usage

    usage: parser.py [-h] [--zim ZIM] [--edition EDITION]
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --zim ZIM, -z ZIM     use zim file instead of html
      --edition EDITION, -e EDITION
                            explicitly specify the language edition

### Run parser.py with zim

To run `parser.py` with a `.zim` file:

    $ python parser.py -z [zimfile]

- Support for using `.zim` file has only been tested for `Python 3.5`. It is probably not working for `Python 2` at this moment.

The edition will be inferred from the metadata of the `.zim` file. If you want to specify the edition explicitly:

    $ python parser.py -z [zimfile] -e [edition]

### Test a single parser with html

There are two ways to use the predefined urls:

1. Omit the `-z` flag:

        $ python parser.py -e [edition]

    E.g. 

        $ python parser.py -e ja

1. Tell python to run the `main()` in the specific parser:

        $ python -m parser.[FILENAME]

	E.g. , to test `parse_ja.py`:

        $ python -m parser.parse_ja
        
    Notice there is no `.py` extension.

## Progress

- Tested with `.zim`: `ja`
- Tested with some representative `.html` pages: `az` `de` `fr` `ru` `tr` `uz` `vi`
- Started: `pl`

## Common

The list of common things in different editions are listed in [common.md](common.md).

## Todo

- Write parsers for two or three editions.
	- Run parsers on zim files (entire foreign editions of Wiktionary)
- Generalize them and create a skeleton for writing other parsers.
  - make it so that we need minimal changes in order to parse another edition
- Generate parsers for editions of interest.
- Use translation scripts as base for derivation-table-parsing scripts.
